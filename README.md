# Square Root Quiz 🧮

I'm a bit of a math nerd. When I'm waiting for a build to finish or sitting in a waiting room, I like to keep my mind busy with mental math challenges.

A while back, I learned this cool trick for calculating the square root of any perfect square in your head — no calculator needed. It felt like a superpower once I got the hang of it, and I wanted a way to practice.

So I built this little quiz to sharpen my skills and track my progress. It times each answer, shows whether I'm getting faster, and even has a handy "Learn the trick!" button that explains the method step by step.

I hope you enjoy using this as much as I enjoyed making it.

## 💡 The Trick

Click "Learn the trick!" in the quiz for the full explanation, but here's the gist:

1. **Last digit tells you the ending** — If the number ends in 6, the root ends in 4 or 6. If it ends in 9, the root ends in 3 or 7. And so on.

2. **First digits tell you the beginning** — Drop the last two digits and find the largest square that fits.

3. **Quick multiply to pick high or low** — Multiply that number by the next one up to decide which ending to use.

**Example:** √4,356 = ?
- Ends in 6 → root ends in 4 or 6  
- Drop "56" → 43 remaining → 6² = 36 fits  
- 6 × 7 = 42 ≤ 43 → use the higher digit  
- **Answer: 66** ✓
